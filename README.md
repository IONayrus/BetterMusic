=======

This mod provides you with a wider range of notes and  timing possibilities for your note block songs!
Currently in Alpha.

Upcoming features:
- GUI for value setting, allows set-mode (not only add)

- Pattern item for copy/pasting your builds
- Note Block Studio integration (have not checked if possible)
